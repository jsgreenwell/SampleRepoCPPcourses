# SampleRepoCPPcourses
A sample template for files and setup with C++ courses like COP 2006 &amp; 3003 for students to follow.
This is using the SFML library which doesn't have binaries for most IDEs. As such this was built on
Windows (tested 10 & 11) with CLion to include a source build of the library for students to just start working.

It also is set up in the basic configuration a "Pong" game might contain to provide an example of
an Object-Oriented Program. With placeholder classes used for illustration and some guidance
in the readme files.

It contains a base License (for copy if needed), a "Hello World" c++ source with CMAKE for example, and this Readme markdown file.
